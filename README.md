# Proposal-
About Intern Proposal to startup.

Filli Cafe(One of the Cafe) do not use advance data analysis to improve and evaluate their performance ,I proposed them to initiate with the same .Since i was looking for internship i needed indepth knowledge of how actually in real life Data analysis work and wanted to upgrade my existing skill. I used advance software engineering tools to propose the concerned person with clear understanding of how the things will work. My proposal was accepted and i started a intern role as a data analysis .There was  a POS server from which i have to extract data,since datasets was too messy i cleaned it and made data tidy and started doing computation using Python libraries(numpy,pandas,matplotlib,seaborn,etc) once i got cleaned dataset i used Tableau for powerfull visualization and made multiple dashboard and then Python to find hidden correlation to find hidden insights.
